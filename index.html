           <h2>Let’s take a minute to appreciate how incredible Ariana Grande’s voice is</h2>
          
        <h2>She has one of the most impressive ranges of any female singer in the pop music industry, and she makes it all look So. Darn. Easy.</h2>
        <p>‘Dangerous Woman’ was one of 2016’s best pop hits, and a No. 1 single for Ariana Grande.</p>
      <p>
      Melodically speaking, it’s not a particularly interesting song. And if performed by a lesser soprano, the melody would inevitably start to drag after the first chorus. But what is interesting is Ariana’s vocal treatment of the song.
        </p>
        <p>
      As any singer knows, one of the most important parts of the job is to make everything look utterly effortless – even if that involves belting a high G with no instrumental backing.
        </p>
        <p>
      The key to Ariana’s performance is how easily she seems to reach the top end of her – very impressive – four-octave range.
        </p>
        <p>
      She might not have the breath control of a classical soprano, but she also never throws a breath away, using it instead as a technique to communicate emotion and add texture to her sound.
        </p>
      <p>
      What’s also interesting is her ability to switch from her softly vocalised mid-range to that characteristically ‘Ariana’-style belt – a mix of chest and head voice.
        </p>
         <p>
      She is at her strongest in live acoustic sessions – just listen to her more recent performance of ‘God is a Woman’ on Good Morning America.
